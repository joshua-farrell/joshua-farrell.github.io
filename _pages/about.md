I am a assistant director of institutional research at 4 year College in the pacific northwest.

I am in the final stages of completing Master's Degree in Data Scinece and I am enjoying an exploration of machine learning and its applications in Higher Education research. I try to spend as much time outdoors and I do staring at a monitor.
