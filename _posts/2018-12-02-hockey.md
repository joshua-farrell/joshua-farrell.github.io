## Comparison Of Random Forest and K-NN Machine Learning Models to Predict NHL Player Salary

In order to predict how much an NHL hockey player makes, many things are taken 
into consideration. What a player is worth, related to his future performance 
on the ice, is the a most useful but very difficult construct to predict. 
However, knowing the relationship between a player’s market value and current 
variables such as performance statistics and demographics, can help players, 
agents and general managers. Stakeholders can use this relationship to make 
decisions during contract negotiations and can help GM’s make decisions about 
which players they can afford to chase and sign. I will be using a machine 
learning models to predict NHL player salary. This will be a supervised 
classification problem comparing GLM regression, Random Forest and K-Nearest 
Neighbors models. 

The NHL and many other interested parties collect and derive an almost 
uncountable number of statistics related to player performance
