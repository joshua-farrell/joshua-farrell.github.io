## Comparison Of Random Forest and K-NN Machine Learning Models to Predict NHL Player Salary

In order to predict how much an NHL hockey player makes, many things are taken into consideration.  What a player is worth, related to his future performance on the ice, is the most important but very difficult construct to predict. However, knowing the relationship between a player’s market value and known variables such as performance stats and demographics can help players and general managers (GM) make decisions during contract negotiations and can help GM’s make decisions about which players they can afford to chase and sign.  What value will using a K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) model have for predicting NHL player salary AAV and percentage of a team’s salary cap.  This will be a supervised classification problem using a K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning model.  The model with be used to predict player salary. 

There is a folder called shareddocs in the project home.
You can copy your file (any file - not just R and Rmd) there and link to it from your article as below.

The R Scripts for this project can be downloded here
I have separated each script by task to learn how to create a library of reusable code chunks
