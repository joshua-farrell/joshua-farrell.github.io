## Comparison Of Random Forest and K-NN Machine Learning Models to Predict NHL Player Salary

In order to predict how much an NHL hockey player makes, many things are taken into consideration.  What a player is worth, related to his future performance on the ice, is the most important but very difficult construct to predict. However, knowing the relationship between a player’s market value and known variables such as performance stats and demographics, can help players, agents and general managers make decisions during contract negotiations and can help GM’s make decisions about which players they can afford to chase and sign.  What value will using a K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) model have for predicting NHL player salary. This will be a supervised classification problem comparing GLM regression, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors machine learning models.

I will be looking at 2017-18 season with a wide variety of demographic and performance statistics as the dependant variables.
