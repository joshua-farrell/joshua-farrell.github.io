## Student Satisfaction

This data science project explores compares regression, K-Nearest Nighbours and Random forest machine learning models to predict student satisfaction from data aquired from a freshman survey given during freshman orientation.  The dependant variables are related to the folown domains
* Established behaviors in high school
* Academic preparedness
* Admissions decisions
* Expectations of college
* Interactions with peers and faculty
* Student values and goals
* Student demographic characteristics
* Concerns about financing college

We are using the student responses to overall satisfaction with the college experience from a college senior survey given to students in the final year of college.  

There is a folder called shareddocs in the project home.
You can copy your file (any file - not just R and Rmd) there and link to it from your article as below.
