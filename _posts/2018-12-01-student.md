## Student Satisfaction

This data science project compares Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes 
machine learning models to predict student satisfaction from data aquired from a college 
freshman survey given to students during freshman orientation. The dependant variables are 
related to the following domains from the CIRP Freshman Survey (CIRP).  

There were about 324 items in the CIRP Survey collected every three years between 2000 and 2012

- Established behaviors in high school
- Academic preparedness
- Admissions decisions
- Expectations of college
- Interactions with peers and faculty
- Student values and goals
- Student demographic characteristics
- Concerns about financing college
