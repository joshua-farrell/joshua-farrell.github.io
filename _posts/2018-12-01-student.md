## Student Satisfaction

This data science project compares Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes 
machine learning models in predict student satisfaction from data aquired from a college 
freshman survey given to students during freshman orientation. The dependant variables are 
related to the following domains from the CIRP Freshman Survey (CIRP).  

- Established behaviors in high school
- Academic preparedness
- Admissions decisions
- Expectations of college
- Interactions with peers and faculty
- Student values and goals

There were about 324 items in the CIRP Survey collected every three years between 2000 and 2012 these survey resuts were matched student survey results in the College Senior Survey Satisfaction Survey (CSS) 2004 through 2016. The dependant variables are taken from the CSS. There are three satisfaction items on a 5 point likert scale that will be collapsed to two classes. The items measure

- Satisfaction with the overall college experience (overall)
- Satisfaction with the quality instruction (instruction)
- SSatisfaction with college communitu (community)

The Random Forsest model was able to predict overall satisfaction with the college experience with about 80% acuracy.
